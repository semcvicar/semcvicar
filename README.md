Hi I'm Stuart. 
I'm a coder and have been doing it for the past 30 years. 

Professionally, I've spent 11 years doing game development and 10 years doing cloud computing work. 

Game development is the primary interest from the C64 to modern consoles, in assembler(#6502, #68000, x86) or c/c++, I love it. 

Interests include #graphics, #GPU, #CUDA, #optimisation, #assembler, #c/c+, #retrocomputing (#C64, #Amiga), #demoscene, coffee. 

I'm currently working as a GPU R&D engineer at Qualcomm.
